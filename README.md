## Introduction  
Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision. This project uses **autoencoders**, a type of neural network, to learn representations of clean images and remove noise effectively.  

Autoencoders are trained to map noisy images as inputs to clean images as outputs, achieving denoising without requiring handcrafted filters or algorithms.  

---

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of clean and noisy image pairs. The noisy versions were generated by adding synthetic noise (Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, etc.) to clean images.  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Clean images are augmented with noise to create input-output pairs.  
   - Data is normalized and resized for consistency.  

2. **Model Training:**  
   - The autoencoder learns to reconstruct clean images by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between output and target images.  

3. **Evaluation:**  
   - Performance is evaluated using metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).

## Model Architecture  
The autoencoder consists of:  
- **Encoder:** Convolutional layers to capture essential features while compressing the image representation.  
- **Decoder:** Transposed convolutional layers to reconstruct the clean image from the encoded representation.  

### Summary:  
- Encoder: Conv2D → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPooling  
- Decoder: Conv2DTranspose → BatchNorm → ReLU → Output
